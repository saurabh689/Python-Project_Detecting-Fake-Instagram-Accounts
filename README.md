Using Python, we detect fake Instagram accounts via EDA, data cleaning, and logistic regression. Analyzing user engagement helps classify genuine from deceptive activity, contributing to platform integrity
Title: Detecting Fake Instagram Accounts: A Python Data Analyst Project

Description:
In the digital age, social media platforms like Instagram have become breeding grounds for fake accounts, often created for fraudulent purposes such as spreading misinformation, engaging in illicit activities, or inflating follower counts. To combat this issue, our project focuses on leveraging data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms to identify and flag potential fake Instagram accounts based on their liked posts.

Our project begins with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the characteristics of both legitimate and fake Instagram accounts. Through comprehensive data exploration, we uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data that can serve as indicators of suspicious activity. This phase involves visualizing user engagement metrics, such as likes, comments, and post frequency, to distinguish between authentic user behavior and automated or deceptive practices.

Following EDA, we delve into Data Cleaning to preprocess and refine the dataset, ensuring its quality and integrity for subsequent analysis. This step involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats to prepare a clean and structured dataset for model training.

With the data prepared, we employ Logistic Regression, a popular classification algorithm, to build a predictive model capable of discerning between genuine and fake Instagram accounts based on their liked posts. By utilizing features extracted from user engagement data, such as like patterns, timestamps, and post content, our logistic regression model learns to distinguish between legitimate user activity and suspicious behavior indicative of fake accounts.

Throughout the project, emphasis is placed on model evaluation and performance optimization to ensure the effectiveness and reliability of our fake account detection system. We assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score through cross-validation and validation on unseen data, iteratively refining the model to achieve optimal results.

In conclusion, our Python data analyst project offers a comprehensive approach to identifying fake Instagram accounts through a combination of exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and logistic regression modeling. By leveraging data-driven insights and machine learning techniques, we aim to contribute to the ongoing efforts to maintain the integrity and trustworthiness of online social platforms.
